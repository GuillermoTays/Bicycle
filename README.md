Using a PHP framework, create a Bicycle Class and instantiate it. It needs some working parts of a bicycle, and we should be able to run and test it. 

We will be looking for the following: 

Code cleanliness 
Error handling 
OOP paradigms 

I have created a new symfony project.
After created a new class "Bicycle" and added a few functions.
Next added PHPUnit testing of that class.

Using twig template, I rendered the date of bicycle class.
Route : http://localhost:8000/bicycle

Totally took around 2 hours.

Thank you for reading and your consideration.
